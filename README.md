# React + Vite + Shoelave

This project is a quick bootstrap for using React + Vite + Shoelace.

This provides some base setup for Shoelace along with a component directory for handling imports better.

## Components
When using a new component not yet imported into the project. Navigate to `components > shoelace` and add the new component.

This allows for cleaner imports as the base path is setup to use the CDN approach.
